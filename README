Works with Rackspace Cloud right now.

All it does at the moment is authenticate and print out the output.

API Docs: http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v1.0/cs-devguide/content/index.html

To try it out on ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libasio-dev openssl-dev xerces-c-dev xsdcxx
./build.sh
./test API_USERNAME API_KEY
